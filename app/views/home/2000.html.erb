<h2>2000 Olympic Gymnastics</h2>
<p>The most notable fact about this year is that in the women's all-around final, the vault table was mistakenly set to the wrong height. This caused several gymnasts to have dangerous falls, massively reducing their scores. Svetlana Khorkina, a strong challenger for the gold medal, fell on her vault due to the height issue. Although she was given the chance to redo her vault when the problem was found out, she had also fallen on the bars due to the stress of her first fall, so her dream of gold was gone.<br><br>

Another controversy in the 2000 Olympics was that the women's all-around gold medal winner, Andreea Raducan of Romania, was stripped of her title after a banned substance was detected in a blood test. Despite her claims that this was from a cold medicine given to her by a team doctor, she had to return her medal and teammate Simona Amanar was named champion.
